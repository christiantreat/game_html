## Overview

The **Transparent Text-Based Adventure Engine** is a farming village simulation built in HTML where every NPC decision is fully visible and explainable. Unlike traditional games where AI is a "black box," this engine shows you exactly why each character makes every decision.

### What Makes It Unique?

**🔍 Complete Transparency**: Every NPC action comes with:
- The character's current goals
- All options they considered
- Why they chose their action
- What the outcome was

**🎮 Living World**: NPCs have:
- Unique personalities (friendly, shy, greedy, generous, etc.)
- Relationships that evolve based on interactions
- Daily routines and needs
- Transparent decision-making using behavior trees

**🌾 Integrated Systems**: Nine major systems work together:
- Entity-Component System (game objects)
- Event System (action logging)
- Decision System (reasoning tracking)
- Behavior Trees (AI decisions)
- World & Locations (navigation)
- Agriculture (farming mechanics)
- Economy (trading & shops)
- Social (relationships & gifts)
- Game Loop (turn management)

---

## Game Concept

### Setting
You are in a small farming village with fields, shops, and friendly (or not-so-friendly) villagers. The game runs in **turns** where each character (including you and NPCs) takes one action per turn.

### Objective
There's no single "win condition" - instead, you can:
- **Build relationships** with villagers through conversation and gifts
- **Grow crops** and sell them for profit
- **Trade items** at shops to build wealth
- **Explore** the village and discover NPC routines
- **Observe** how NPCs make decisions transparently

### Core Loop
```
1. Morning begins → Characters wake up
2. Each entity decides an action (you see the reasoning)
3. Actions execute (move, talk, plant, buy, etc.)
4. Time advances (morning → afternoon → evening → night)
5. Systems update (crops grow, relationships decay)
6. Next turn begins
```

---

## Core Systems

### 1. Entity-Component System (ECS)

**What it does**: Manages all game objects (you, NPCs, items, locations)

**Components**:
- **Position**: Where entities are in the world
- **Inventory**: What they're carrying
- **Stats**: Health, energy, etc.
- **AI**: Behavior tree for decision-making

**Example**:
```
Farmer (Entity #1)
├─ Position Component: Location #3 (Farm Field)
├─ Inventory Component: 5 Wheat, Hoe, Watering Can
├─ Stats Component: Health 100, Energy 75
└─ AI Component: Behavior Tree "Farmer Routine"
```

### 2. Event System

**What it does**: Logs every action that happens in the game

**Event Types**:
- Social events (talked, gave gift, relationship changed)
- Economic events (bought, sold, traded)
- Farming events (planted, watered, harvested)
- World events (moved, time changed, weather changed)

**Example Event Log**:
```
[Turn 15, Day 2, Afternoon]
EVENT: Entity 1 (Farmer) planted Wheat Seeds at Field (2,3)
  - Used: Wheat Seeds x1
  - Energy cost: 5
  - Result: SUCCESS

EVENT: Entity 2 (Merchant) moved from Market to Village Square
  - Path: Market → Road → Village Square
  - Distance: 2 locations
  - Result: SUCCESS
```

### 3. Decision System

**What it does**: Records WHY each character chose their action

Every decision includes:
- **Situation**: What's happening right now
- **Options**: What actions were available
- **Scores**: How good each option seemed
- **Choice**: What was selected
- **Reason**: Why it was the best option

**Example Decision Log**:
```
Entity 1 (Farmer) - DECISION
Situation: Day 3, Morning, Field location, Energy 80/100
Goal: Maximize crop yield

Options Considered:
  1. Plant Wheat Seeds [Score: 65]
     → Field has empty plots (good)
     → Season is Spring (excellent for wheat)
     → Has seeds in inventory

  2. Water existing crops [Score: 92]
     → 3 crops need water urgently
     → Weather is Sunny (crops will dry out)
     → Has watering can

  3. Harvest Tomatoes [Score: 45]
     → Only 1 tomato plant mature
     → Not priority right now

SELECTED: Water existing crops
REASON: Highest score - prevents crop death from drought
```

### 4. Behavior Trees

**What it does**: Controls NPC AI decisions

Each NPC has a behavior tree that evaluates conditions and picks actions:

```
Farmer's Behavior Tree:
├─ Sequence: Daily Routine
│  ├─ Condition: Is it Morning?
│  ├─ Action: Go to Farm
│  └─ Selector: Farm Work
│     ├─ Action: Water crops (if any need water)
│     ├─ Action: Harvest mature crops
│     └─ Action: Plant seeds (if plots empty)
├─ Sequence: Social Time
│  ├─ Condition: Is it Afternoon?
│  └─ Action: Go to Village Square and talk
└─ Sequence: Evening Routine
   ├─ Condition: Is it Evening?
   └─ Action: Go home and rest
```

## Gameplay Mechanics

### Turn-Based System

**How Turns Work**:
1. **Entity Phase**: Each character gets to act once
   - You choose your action
   - NPCs use their behavior trees to decide
   - All decisions are logged with reasoning

2. **Resolution Phase**: Actions execute in order
   - Movement happens
   - Conversations occur
   - Items are exchanged
   - Farming actions complete

3. **Update Phase**: World state changes
   - Time advances (morning → afternoon → evening → night → new day)
   - Crops grow based on time passed
   - Weather may change
   - Relationships decay if not maintained

### Available Actions

**Movement** (ACTION_MOVE)
- Move between connected locations
- Uses pathfinding to find shortest route
- Example: "Move from Farm to Market"

**Social** (ACTION_TALK, ACTION_GIFT)
- Talk to NPCs (builds affection +3-5)
- Give gifts (affection varies by preference)
- Example: "Give Hoe to Farmer" → +15 affection (loved item!)

**Farming** (ACTION_PLANT, ACTION_WATER, ACTION_HARVEST)
- Plant seeds in field plots
- Water crops to keep them healthy
- Harvest mature crops for items
- Example: "Plant Wheat at plot (2,3)"

**Economy** (ACTION_BUY, ACTION_SELL)
- Buy items from shops
- Sell harvested crops
- Trade between entities
- Example: "Buy Wheat Seeds from General Store"

**Utility** (ACTION_REST, ACTION_WORK, ACTION_WAIT)
- Rest to regain energy
- Work to earn money
- Wait to pass time

---

### Farming Mechanics

**Planting**:
1. Be at a Farm Field location
2. Have seeds in inventory
3. Select empty plot (x, y coordinates)
4. Plant seeds → Crop begins growing

**Watering**:
- Crops need water daily
- Water level: 0-100%
- Decreases by 15% per day
- Rainy weather: +20% water
- Drought weather: -10% water, -5% health

**Crop Health**:
- Health: 0-100%
- Low water (< 20%): -10% health per day
- Wrong season: -2% health per day
- Storm damage: -5% health
- If health reaches 0: Crop withers (dies)

**Growth Speed**:
- Each crop has days to mature
- Grows one stage per time period
- **Quality multipliers**:
  - Perfect care (always watered, right season): 100% speed
  - Good care: 80% speed
  - Poor care: 60% speed

**Harvesting**:
- Crop must be in "Mature" stage
- Use ACTION_HARVEST at the plot
- Receive yield items (base yield ± quality)
- Plot becomes empty (ready for new seeds)

**Yield Calculation**:
```
Base Yield: 6 wheat (example)
Health Modifier: 100% health = 1.0x, 50% health = 0.5x
Quality Modifier: NORMAL = 1.0x, GOOD = 1.5x, EXCELLENT = 2.0x

Final Yield = Base × Health × Quality
Example: 6 × 1.0 × 1.0 = 6 wheat
Example: 6 × 0.8 × 1.5 = 7 wheat (good quality, slight damage)
```

---

### Seasons & Weather

**The Four Seasons**:
- **Spring** (Days 1-90): Best for Wheat
- **Summer** (Days 91-180): Best for Corn, Tomato
- **Fall** (Days 181-270): Best for Carrot
- **Winter** (Days 271-360): Harsh (-20% growth for most crops)

**Weather Effects**:
- ☀️ **Sunny**: Normal growth, crops dry faster
- 🌧️ **Rainy**: +20% water to all crops
- ☁️ **Cloudy**: Normal growth, slower water loss
- ⛈️ **Stormy**: -5% health damage to crops
- 🏜️ **Drought**: -10% water, -5% health per day

**Time of Day** (4 periods):
- 🌅 **Morning** (0600-1200): NPCs start work
- ☀️ **Afternoon** (1200-1800): Social time
- 🌆 **Evening** (1800-0000): Winding down

## Transparent AI

### Why Transparency Matters

Traditional games hide AI decisions - you never know WHY an NPC does something. This game shows you **everything**:

### Decision Transparency Example

```
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
TURN 42 - Day 5, Afternoon, Sunny Weather
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

ENTITY: Farmer (ID 1)
LOCATION: Farm Field 3
ENERGY: 65/100
GOLD: 245

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
🧠 DECISION PROCESS
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

CURRENT GOALS:
  Primary: Maximize crop yield this season
  Secondary: Maintain good health/energy
  Tertiary: Build relationships with villagers

CURRENT SITUATION:
  ✓ At farm location (can farm)
  ✓ Has 12 wheat crops planted
  ✗ 8 crops need watering (URGENT)
  ✓ 2 crops ready to harvest
  ✓ Has watering can in inventory
  ✓ Energy sufficient (65/100)
  ✓ Weather is Sunny (crops dry faster)

OPTIONS EVALUATED:

  1️⃣ WATER CROPS [Score: 95]
     Reasoning:
     + 8 crops critically need water
     + Sunny weather = faster water loss
     + Has watering can (no prep needed)
     + Prevents 8 crops from withering
     - Uses 15 energy

     Calculation:
       Urgency: +40 (critical need)
       Tools Available: +20 (has can)
       Weather Factor: +20 (sunny = urgent)
       Crop Value at Risk: +15 (8 crops worth ~96 gold)
       = 95/100

  2️⃣ HARVEST MATURE CROPS [Score: 72]
     Reasoning:
     + 2 wheat crops are mature
     + Will earn ~24 gold
     + Frees up 2 plots for new seeds
     - Only 2 crops (not urgent)
     - Uses 10 energy

     Calculation:
       Urgency: +20 (mature but not over-ripe)
       Profit: +25 (24 gold)
       Efficiency: +15 (quick action)
       Priority: +12 (lower than watering)
       = 72/100

  3️⃣ PLANT NEW SEEDS [Score: 45]
     Reasoning:
     + Has 15 wheat seeds in inventory
     + Has empty plots available
     + Good season for wheat (Spring)
     - Other tasks more urgent
     - Energy cost: 5 per seed

     Calculation:
       Opportunity: +25 (empty plots)
       Season Match: +15 (Spring is good)
       Urgency: +5 (can wait)
       = 45/100

  4️⃣ GO TO VILLAGE SQUARE [Score: 30]
     Reasoning:
     + Could socialize (afternoon is social time)
     + Build relationships with villagers
     - Farm tasks more urgent
     - Travel time wastes daylight

     Calculation:
       Social Time: +15 (afternoon)
       Relationship Value: +10
       Priority: +5 (low)
       = 30/100

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
✅ DECISION MADE
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

SELECTED: Water Crops (Option 1)

WHY THIS CHOICE:
  "Watering has highest score (95) because 8 crops are
  critically low on water in sunny weather. Letting them
  wither would lose ~96 gold in crop value. While harvesting
  would earn 24 gold now, preventing 96 gold loss is more
  valuable. Social time can wait - crops cannot."

EXPECTED OUTCOME:
  - Energy: 65 → 50 (-15)
  - All 8 crops: Water 15% → 85% (+70%)
  - Crop health preserved
  - No gold change
  - Time: Afternoon → Afternoon (same period)

─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
⚡ ACTION EXECUTION
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

ACTION: Water Crops
LOCATION: Farm Field 3
PLOTS WATERED: (2,1), (2,2), (3,1), (3,2), (4,1), (4,2), (5,1), (5,2)

RESULT: ✅ SUCCESS

ACTUAL OUTCOME:
  ✓ 8 wheat crops watered
  ✓ Water levels: 15% → 85%
  ✓ All crops healthy (100% health maintained)
  ✓ Energy: 65 → 50
  ✓ Time cost: 0 (completed in same period)

EVENTS GENERATED:
  [EVENT] Entity 1 watered crops at Farm Field 3
  [EVENT] 8 crops received water (+70% each)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
```

This level of detail is available for **every single action** in the game!

### Behavior Tree Visualization

The game uses **Behavior Trees** for NPC AI. Here's what the Farmer's tree looks like:

```
🌳 FARMER'S BEHAVIOR TREE

ROOT: Farmer Daily Routine
│
├─ SEQUENCE: Morning Routine [TIME: Morning]
│  ├─ CONDITION: Is it morning? ✓
│  ├─ CONDITION: Am I at farm? ✗
│  ├─ ACTION: Move to Farm Field
│  └─ SELECTOR: Farm Work
│     ├─ SEQUENCE: Emergency Watering [Priority: Critical]
│     │  ├─ CONDITION: Any crops below 20% water? ✓
│     │  └─ ACTION: Water all dry crops ← SELECTED
│     │
│     ├─ SEQUENCE: Harvest Ready Crops [Priority: High]
│     │  ├─ CONDITION: Any crops mature? ✓
│     │  └─ ACTION: Harvest mature crops
│     │
│     ├─ SEQUENCE: Tend Crops [Priority: Medium]
│     │  ├─ CONDITION: Any crops need care? ✓
│     │  └─ ACTION: Water crops below 50%
│     │
│     └─ SEQUENCE: Plant New Crops [Priority: Low]
│        ├─ CONDITION: Empty plots available? ✓
│        ├─ CONDITION: Have seeds? ✓
│        └─ ACTION: Plant seeds
│
├─ SEQUENCE: Afternoon Routine [TIME: Afternoon]
│  ├─ CONDITION: Is it afternoon? ✗
│  ├─ ACTION: Move to Village Square
│  └─ SELECTOR: Social Activities
│     ├─ ACTION: Talk to nearby NPCs
│     └─ ACTION: Rest on bench
│
├─ SEQUENCE: Evening Routine [TIME: Evening]
│  ├─ CONDITION: Is it evening? ✗
│  ├─ ACTION: Move to Market
│  └─ ACTION: Sell harvested crops
│
└─ SEQUENCE: Night Routine [TIME: Night]
   ├─ CONDITION: Is it night? ✗
   ├─ ACTION: Move to Home
   └─ ACTION: Sleep (restore energy)

CURRENT STATUS: Morning → Emergency Watering Selected
```

**How It Works**:
1. Tree evaluates from top to bottom
2. **Sequences** require all children to succeed
3. **Selectors** try children until one succeeds
4. **Conditions** check game state (time, location, inventory)
5. **Actions** are the actual things NPCs do

### Memory Management

**HTML with Manual Memory**:
- All allocations use `calloc()` for initialization
- All structures have `destroy()` functions
- No memory leaks (tested with valgrind)
- Efficient ring buffers for event/decision logs

**Example**:
// Creation
GameLoop* loop = game_loop_create();
game_loop_initialize(loop);

// Usage
game_loop_start(loop);
game_loop_process_turn(loop);

// Cleanup
game_loop_destroy(loop);  // Frees all memory
```
